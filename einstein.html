    <p>Welcome to this page of Einstein. Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the special and general 
      theories of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its 
      influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, 
      which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, 
      and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a crucial step in the development of quantum theory.

        <p>Einstein was born in the German city of Ulm on March 14, 1879. He was the son of a salesman and engineer. 
        Einstein showed an early talent for mathematics and physics, and in 1896 he enrolled at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. 
        He received his doctorate in 1905, and the same year he published four groundbreaking papers that would change the course of physics.
